## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the application
```bash
yarn build
```
This compiles the Next.js application for production.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Seed the database (for demo data)
```bash
yarn seed
```
This runs a script to populate your local MongoDB with example patients.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the app
In production mode:
```bash
yarn start
```
Or in development mode (auto reload on file changes):
```bash
yarn dev
```

## üîó Open in your browser
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/patients](http://localhost:3000/api/pateints). This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/pateints.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
